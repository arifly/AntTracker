# AntTracker
Antenna Tracker for tracking a moving model aircraft or drone with a small high-gain UHF or SHF antenna. 
Supports Mavlink 1 & 2, Frsky D legacy, X S.Port and Passthru, LTM, and GPS

Please click on WiKi above

Modified for BLE, Crossfire and KISS Firmware
and use with newer QMC5883 (no Status) or Drotek GPS with Compass (Upside-down + rotated)
and WS2812 as Status LED

You need to change the last part of serviceUUID and charUUID to your Transmitter BLE address:
I use nRF Connect for Mobile to get it.
